gradio.Audio(Â·Â·Â·)
Creates an audio component that can be used to upload/record audio (as an input) or display audio (as an output).
 As input:  passes the uploaded audio as a Tuple(int, numpy.array) corresponding to (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a 16-bit int array whose values range from -32768 to 32767), or as a str filepath, depending on `type`.
 As output: expects a Tuple(int, numpy.array) corresponding to (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a float or int numpy array) or as a str filepath or URL to an audio file, which gets displayed
 Format expected for examples: a str filepath to a local file that contains audio.
Supported events: check_streamable()
str | Tuple[int, np.ndarray] | Callable | None
default: None
A path, URL, or [sample_rate, numpy array] tuple (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a float or int numpy array) for the default value that Audio component is going to take. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
str
default: "upload"
Source of audio. "upload" creates a box where user can drop an audio file, "microphone" creates a microphone input.
str
default: "numpy"
The format the audio file is converted to before being passed into the prediction function. "numpy" converts the audio to a tuple consisting of: (int sample rate, numpy.array for the data), "filepath" passes a str path to a temporary file containing the audio.
str | None
default: None
component name in interface.
float | None
default: None
If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. Queue must be enabled. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
bool
default: True
if True, will display label.
bool | None
default: None
if True, will allow users to upload and edit a audio file; if False, can only be used to play audio. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.
bool
default: True
If False, component will be hidden.
bool
default: False
If set to True when used in a `live` interface, will automatically stream webcam feed. Only valid is source is 'microphone'.
str | None
default: None
An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
List[str] | str | None
default: None
An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.

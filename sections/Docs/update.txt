Updates component properties. When a function passed into a Gradio Interface or a Blocks events returns a typical value, it updates the value of the output component. But it is also possible to update the properties of an output component (such as the number of lines of a `Textbox` or the visibility of an `Image`) by returning the component's `update()` function, which takes as parameters any of the constructor parameters for that component. This is a shorthand for using the update method on a component. For example, rather than using gr.Number.update(...) you can just use gr.update(...). Note that your editor's autocompletion will suggest proper parameters if you use the update method on the component.

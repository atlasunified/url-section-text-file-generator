This event is triggered when the user stops the component (e.g. audio or video). This method can be used when this component is in a Gradio Blocks.
Callable | None
required
the function to wrap an interface around. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
Component | List[Component] | Set[Component] | None
default: None
List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
Component | List[Component] | None
default: None
List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
str | None
default: None
Defining this parameter exposes the endpoint in the api docs
StatusTracker | None
default: None

bool
default: False
If True, will scroll to output component on completion
bool | None
default: None
If True, will show progress animation while pending
bool | None
default: None
If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
bool
default: False
If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
int
default: 4
Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
bool
default: True
If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
bool
default: True
If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
Dict[str, Any] | List[Dict[str, Any]] | None
default: None
A list of other events to cancel when this event is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
float | None
default: None
Run this event 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Interpreted in seconds. Queue must be enabled.

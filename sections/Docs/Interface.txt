Interface is Gradio's main high-level class, and allows you to create a web-based GUI / demo around a machine learning model (or any Python function) in a few lines of code. You must specify three parameters: (1) the function to create a GUI for (2) the desired input components and (3) the desired output components. Additional parameters can be used to control the appearance and behavior of the demo.

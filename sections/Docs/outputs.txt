gradio_client.Job.outputs(Â·Â·Â·)
Returns a list containing the latest outputs from the Job.  If the endpoint has multiple output components, the list will contain a tuple of results. Otherwise, it will contain the results without storing them in tuples.  For endpoints that are queued, this list will contain the final job output even if that endpoint does not use a generator function.

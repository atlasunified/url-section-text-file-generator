Blocks is Gradio's low-level API that allows you to create more custom web applications and demos than Interfaces (yet still entirely in Python).   Compared to the Interface class, Blocks offers more flexibility and control over: (1) the layout of components (2) the events that trigger the execution of functions (3) data flows (e.g. inputs can trigger outputs, which can trigger the next level of outputs). Blocks also offers ways to group together related demos such as with tabs.   The basic usage of Blocks is as follows: create a Blocks object, then use it as a context (with the "with" statement), and then define layouts, components, or events within the Blocks context. Finally, call the launch() method to launch the demo.

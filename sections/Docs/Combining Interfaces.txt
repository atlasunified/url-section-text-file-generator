              Once you have created several Interfaces, we provide several classes that let you
              start combining them together. For example, you can chain them in Series
              or compare their outputs in Parallel if the inputs and outputs match accordingly.
              You can also display arbitrary Interfaces together in a tabbed layout using TabbedInterface.

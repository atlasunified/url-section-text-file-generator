Creates a file component that allows uploading generic file (when used as an input) and or displaying generic files (output).
 As input:  passes the uploaded file as a tempfile._TemporaryFileWrapper or List[tempfile._TemporaryFileWrapper] depending on `file_count` (or a bytes/Listbytes depending on `type`)
 As output: expects function to return a str path to a file, or List[str] consisting of paths to files.
 Format expected for examples: a str path to a local file that populates the component.
str | List[str] | Callable | None
default: None
Default file to display, given as str file path. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
str
default: "single"
if single, allows user to upload one file. If "multiple", user uploads multiple files. If "directory", user uploads all files in selected directory. Return type will be list for each file in case of "multiple" or "directory".
List[str] | None
default: None
List of file extensions or types of files to be uploaded (e.g. ['image', '.json', '.mp4']). "file" allows any file to be uploaded, "image" allows only image files to be uploaded, "audio" allows only audio files to be uploaded, "video" allows only video files to be uploaded, "text" allows only text files to be uploaded.
str
default: "file"
Type of value to be returned by component. "file" returns a temporary file object with the same base name as the uploaded file, whose full path can be retrieved by file_obj.name, "binary" returns an bytes object.
str | None
default: None
component name in interface.
float | None
default: None
If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. Queue must be enabled. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
bool
default: True
if True, will display label.
bool | None
default: None
if True, will allow users to upload a file; if False, can only be used to display files. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.
bool
default: True
If False, component will be hidden.
str | None
default: None
An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
List[str] | str | None
default: None
An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.

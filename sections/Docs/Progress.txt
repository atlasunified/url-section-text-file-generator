gradio.Progress(Â·Â·Â·)
The Progress class provides a custom progress tracker that is used in a function signature. To attach a Progress tracker to a function, simply add a parameter right after the input parameters that has a default value set to a `gradio.Progress()` instance. The Progress tracker can then be updated in the function by calling the Progress object or using the `tqdm` method on an Iterable. The Progress tracker is currently only available with `queue()`.

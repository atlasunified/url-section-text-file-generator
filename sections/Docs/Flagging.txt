              A Gradio Interface includes a "Flag" button that appears
              underneath the output. By default, clicking on the Flag button sends the input and output
              data back to the machine where the gradio demo is running, and saves it to a CSV log file.
              But this default behavior can be changed. To set what happens when the Flag button is clicked,
              you pass an instance of a subclass of FlaggingCallback to the flagging_callback parameter
              in the Interface constructor. You can use one of the FlaggingCallback subclasses
              that are listed below, or you can create your own, which lets you do whatever
              you want with the data that is being flagged.

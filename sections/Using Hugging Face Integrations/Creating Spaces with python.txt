Making use of the huggingface_hub client library library you can create new Spaces or model repositories. You can do this even in a Gradio Space! You can find an example space here. This Space creates a new Space comparing different models or spaces with the support of Gradio load and Parallel. Now you can try creating cool spaces with all kinds of functionality ð.
Here, create_repo creates a gradio repo with the target name under a specific account using that account's Write Token. repo_name gets the full repo name of the related repo. Finally upload_file uploads a file inside the repo with the name app.py.

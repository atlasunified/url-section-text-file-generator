Another type of data persistence Gradio supports is session state, where data persists across multiple submits within a page session. However, data is not shared between different users of your model. To store data in a session state, you need to do three things:
A chatbot is an example where you would need session state - you want access to a users previous submissions, but you cannot store chat history in a global variable, because then chat history would get jumbled between different users. 

Notice how the state persists across submits within each page, but if you load this demo in another tab (or refresh the page), the demos will not share chat history. 
The default value of state is None. If you pass a default value to the state parameter of the function, it is used as the default value of the state instead. The Interface class only supports a single input and outputs state variable, though it can be a list with multiple elements. For more complex use cases, you can use Blocks, which supports multiple State variables.

You can also specify a path to a directory containing your examples. If your Interface takes only a single file-type input, e.g. an image classifier, you can simply pass a directory filepath to the examples= argument, and the Interface will load the images in the directory as examples. 
In the case of multiple inputs, this directory must
contain a log.csv file with the example values.
In the context of the calculator demo, we can set  examples='/demo/calculator/examples' and in that directory we include the following log.csv file:
This can be helpful when browsing flagged data. Simply point to the flagged directory and the Interface will load the examples from the flagged data.

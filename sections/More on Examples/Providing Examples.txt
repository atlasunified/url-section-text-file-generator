As covered in the Key Features guide, adding examples to an Interface is as easy as providing a list of lists to the examples
keyword argument. 
Each sublist is a data sample, where each element corresponds to an input of the prediction function.
The inputs must be ordered in the same order as the prediction function expects them.
If your interface only has one input component, then you can provide your examples as a regular list instead of a list of lists.

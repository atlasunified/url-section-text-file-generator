You may wish to provide some cached examples of your model for users to quickly try out, in case your model takes a while to run normally.
If cache_examples=True, the Interface will run all of your examples through your app and save the outputs when you call the launch() method. This data will be saved in a directory called gradio_cached_examples. 
Whenever a user clicks on an example, the output will automatically be populated in the app now, using data from this cached directory instead of actually running the function. This is useful so users can quickly try out your model without adding any load!  
Keep in mind once the cache is generated, it will not be updated in future launches. If the examples or function logic change, delete the cache folder to clear the cache and rebuild it with another launch().

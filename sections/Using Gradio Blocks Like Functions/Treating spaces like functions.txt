Let's say we have the following demo that translates english text to german text. 
import gradio as gr

from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("translation", model="t5-base")


def translate(text):
    return pipe(text)[0]["translation_text"]


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            english = gr.Textbox(label="English text")
            translate_btn = gr.Button(value="Translate")
        with gr.Column():
            german = gr.Textbox(label="German Text")

    translate_btn.click(translate, inputs=english, outputs=german, api_name="translate-to-german")
    examples = gr.Examples(examples=["I went to the supermarket yesterday.", "Helen is a good swimmer."],
                           inputs=[english])

demo.launch()
I already went ahead and hosted it in Hugging Face spaces at gradio/english_translator.
You can see the demo below as well:

Now, let's say you have an app that generates english text, but you wanted to additionally generate german text.
You could either:
Copy the source code of my english-to-german translation and paste it in your app.
Load my english-to-german translation in your app and treat it like a normal python function.
Option 1 technically always works, but it often introduces unwanted complexity.
Option 2 lets you borrow the functionality you want without tightly coupling our apps.
All you have to do is call the Blocks.load class method in your source file.
After that, you can use my translation app like a regular python function!
The following code snippet and demo shows how to use Blocks.load.
Note that the variable english_translator is my english to german app, but its used in generate_text like a regular function.
import gradio as gr

from transformers import pipeline

english_translator = gr.Blocks.load(name="spaces/gradio/english_translator")
english_generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2")


def generate_text(text):
    english_text = english_generator(text)[0]["generated_text"]
    german_text = english_translator(english_text)
    return english_text, german_text


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            seed = gr.Text(label="Input Phrase")
        with gr.Column():
            english = gr.Text(label="Generated English Text")
            german = gr.Text(label="Generated German Text")
    btn = gr.Button("Generate")
    btn.click(generate_text, inputs=[seed], outputs=[english, german])
    gr.Examples(["My name is Clara and I am"], inputs=[seed])

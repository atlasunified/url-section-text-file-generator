If the app you are loading defines more than one function, you can specify which function to use
with the fn_index and api_name parameters.
In the code for our english to german demo, you'll see the following line:
The api_name gives this function a unique name in our app. You can use this name to tell gradio which
function in the upstream space you want to use:
You can also use the fn_index parameter.
Imagine my app also defined an english to spanish translation function.
In order to use it in our text generation app, we would use the following code:
Functions in gradio spaces are zero-indexed, so since the spanish translator would be the second function in my space,
you would use index 1.

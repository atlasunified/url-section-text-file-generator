Gradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the theme= kwarg to the Interface constructor. For example:
demo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())

Gradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from gr.themes.*. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the Theming guide for more details.
For additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS to your app using the css= kwarg.
The base class for the Gradio app is gradio-container, so here's an example that changes the background color of the Gradio app:
with gr.Interface(css=".gradio-container {background-color: red}") as demo:
    ...

Some components can be additionally styled through the style() method. For example:
img = gr.Image("lion.jpg").style(height='24', rounded=False)

Take a look at the Docs to see all the styling options for each Component.

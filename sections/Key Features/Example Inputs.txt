You can provide example data that a user can easily load into Interface. This can be helpful to demonstrate the types of inputs the model expects, as well as to provide a way to explore your dataset in conjunction with your model. To load example data, you can provide a nested list to the examples=  keyword argument of the Interface constructor. Each sublist within the outer list represents a data sample, and each element within the sublist represents an input for each input component. The format of example data for each component is specified in the Docs.
import gradio as gr

def calculator(num1, operation, num2):
    if operation == "add":
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        if num2 == 0:
            raise gr.Error("Cannot divide by zero!")
        return num1 / num2

demo = gr.Interface(
    calculator,
    [
        "number", 
        gr.Radio(["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"]),

    ],

        [4, "divide", 2],
        [-4, "multiply", 2.5],
        [0, "subtract", 1.2],
    ],

You can load a large dataset into the examples to browse and interact with the dataset through Gradio. The examples will be automatically paginated (you can configure this through the examples_per_page argument of Interface).

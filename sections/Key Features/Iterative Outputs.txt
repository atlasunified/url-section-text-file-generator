In some cases, you may want to stream a sequence of outputs rather than show a single output at once. For example, you might have an image generation model and you want to show the image that is generated at each step, leading up to the final image. Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one word at a time instead of returning it all at once.
In such cases, you can supply a generator function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single return value, a function should yield a series of values instead. Usually the yield statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:
You supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image:

Note that we've added a time.sleep(1) in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).
Supplying a generator into Gradio requires you to enable queuing in the underlying Interface or Blocks (see the queuing section above).

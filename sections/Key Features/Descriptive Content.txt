In the previous example, you may have noticed the title= and description= keyword arguments in the Interface constructor that helps users understand your app.
There are three arguments in the Interface constructor to specify where this content should go:

If you're using the Blocks API instead, you can insert text, markdown, or HTML anywhere using the gr.Markdown(...) or gr.HTML(...) components, with descriptive content inside the Component constructor.
Another useful keyword argument is label=, which is present in every Component. This modifies the label text at the top of each Component. You can also add the info= keyword argument to form elements like Textbox or Radio to provide further information on their usage.
gr.Number(label='Age', info='In years, must be greater than 0')

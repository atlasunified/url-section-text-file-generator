Elements within a with gr.Row clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        btn1 = gr.Button("Button 1")
        btn2 = gr.Button("Button 2")

To make every element in a Row have the same height, use the equal_height argument of the style method.
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row().style(equal_height=True):
        textbox = gr.Textbox()
        btn2 = gr.Button("Button 2")

You can also create Tabs using the with gr.Tab('tab_name'): clause. Any component created inside of a with gr.Tab('tab_name'): context appears in that tab. Consecutive Tab clauses are grouped together so that a single tab can be selected at one time, and only the components within that Tab's context are shown.
For example:

Also note the gr.Accordion('label') in this example. The Accordion is a layout that can be toggled open or closed. Like Tabs, it is a layout element that can selectively hide or show content. Any components that are defined inside of a with gr.Accordion('label'): will be hidden or shown when the accordion's toggle icon is clicked.

In some cases, you might want to define components before you actually render them in your UI. For instance, you might want to show an examples section using gr.Examples above the corresponding gr.Textbox input. Since gr.Examples requires as a parameter the input component object, you will need to first define the input component, but then render it later, after you have defined the gr.Examples object.
The solution to this is to define the gr.Textbox outside of the gr.Blocks() scope and use the component's .render() method wherever you'd like it placed in the UI.
Here's a full code example:
input_textbox = gr.Textbox()

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Examples(["hello", "bonjour", "merhaba"], input_textbox)
    input_textbox.render()

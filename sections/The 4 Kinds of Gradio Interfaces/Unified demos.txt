A demo that has a single component as both the input and the output. It can simply be created by setting the values of the inputs and outputs parameter as the same component. Here's an example demo of a text generation model:
import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model = 'gpt2')

def generate_text(text_prompt):
  response = generator(text_prompt, max_length = 30, num_return_sequences=5)
  return response[0]['generated_text']

textbox = gr.Textbox()

demo = gr.Interface(generate_text, textbox, textbox)

demo.launch()

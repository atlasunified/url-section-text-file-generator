Gradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the theme= kwarg to the Blocks constructor. For example:
with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Glass()):
    ...

Gradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from gr.themes.*. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the Theming guide for more details.
For additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS to your app using the css= kwarg.
The base class for the Gradio app is gradio-container, so here's an example that changes the background color of the Gradio app:
with gr.Blocks(css=".gradio-container {background-color: red}") as demo:
    ...

If you'd like to reference external files in your css, preface the file path (which can be a relative or absolute path) with "file=", for example:
with gr.Blocks(css=".gradio-container {background: url('file=clouds.jpg')}") as demo:
    ...

You can also pass the filepath to a CSS file to the css argument.

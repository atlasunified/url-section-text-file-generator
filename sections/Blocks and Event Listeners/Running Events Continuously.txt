You can run events on a fixed schedule using the every parameter of the event listener. This will run the event
every number of seconds while the client connection is open. If the connection is closed, the event will stop running after the following iteration.
Note that this does not take into account the runtime of the event itself. So a function
with a 1 second runtime running with every=5, would actually run every 6 seconds.
Here is an example of a sine curve that updates every second!

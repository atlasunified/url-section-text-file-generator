The return value of an event listener function is usually the updated value of the corresponding output Component. Sometimes we want to update the configuration of the Component as well, such as the visibility. In this case, we return a gr.update() object instead of just the update Component value.

See how we can configure the Textbox itself through the gr.update() method. The value= argument can still be used to update the value along with Component configuration.

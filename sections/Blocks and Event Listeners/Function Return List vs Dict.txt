Similarly, you may return values for multiple output components either as:
Let's first see an example of (1), where we set the values of two output components by returning two values:
Above, each return statement returns two values corresponding to food_box and status_box, respectively.
Instead of returning a list of values corresponding to each output component in order, you can also return a dictionary, with the key corresponding to the output component and the value as the new value. This also allows you to skip updating some output components. 
Notice how when there is no food, we only update the status_box element. We skipped updating the food_box component.
Dictionary returns are helpful when an event listener affects many components on return, or conditionally affects outputs and not others.
Keep in mind that with dictionary returns, we still need to specify the possible outputs in the event listener.

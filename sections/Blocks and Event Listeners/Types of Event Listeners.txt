Take a look at the demo below:
import gradio as gr

def welcome(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown(
    """
    # Hello World!
    Start typing below to see the output.
    """)
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()
    inp.change(welcome, inp, out)

demo.launch()

Instead of being triggered by a click, the welcome function is triggered by typing in the Textbox inp. This is due to the change() event listener. Different Components support different event listeners. For example, the Video Component supports a play() event listener, triggered when a user presses play. See the Docs for the event listeners for each Component.

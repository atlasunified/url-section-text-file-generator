If you'd like to have more fine-grained control over any aspect of your demo, you can also write your own css or pass in a filepath to a css file, with the css parameter of the Interface class.
gr.Interface(..., css="body {background-color: red}")

If you'd like to reference external files in your css, preface the file path (which can be a relative or absolute path) with "file=", for example:
gr.Interface(..., css="body {background-image: url('file=clouds.jpg')}")

Some components have a "streaming" mode, such as Audio component in microphone mode, or the Image component in webcam mode. Streaming means data is sent continuously to the backend and the Interface function is continuously being rerun. 
The difference between gr.Audio(source='microphone') and gr.Audio(source='microphone', streaming=True), when both are used in gr.Interface(live=True), is that the first  Component will automatically submit data and run the Interface function when the user stops recording, whereas the second Component will continuously send data and run the Interface function during recording.
Here is example code of streaming images from the webcam.
import gradio as gr
import numpy as np

def flip(im):
    return np.flipud(im)

demo = gr.Interface(
    flip, 
    gr.Image(source="webcam", streaming=True), 
    "image",
    live=True
)
demo.launch()

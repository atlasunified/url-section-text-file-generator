You can make interfaces automatically refresh by setting live=True in the interface. Now the interface will recalculate as soon as the user input changes.
import gradio as gr

def calculator(num1, operation, num2):
    if operation == "add":
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        return num1 / num2

demo = gr.Interface(
    calculator,
    [
        "number",
        gr.Radio(["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"]),
        "number"
    ],
    "number",
    live=True,
)
demo.launch()


Note there is no submit button, because the interface resubmits automatically on change.

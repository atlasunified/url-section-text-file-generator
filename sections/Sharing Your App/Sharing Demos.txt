Gradio demos can be easily shared publicly by setting share=True in the launch() method. Like this:
demo.launch(share=True)

This generates a public, shareable link that you can send to anybody! When you send this link, the user on the other side can try out the model in their browser. Because the processing happens on your device (as long as your device stays on!), you don't have to worry about any packaging any dependencies. A share link usually looks something like this:  XXXXX.gradio.app. Although the link is served through a Gradio URL, we are only a proxy for your local server, and do not store any data sent through your app.
Keep in mind, however, that these links are publicly accessible, meaning that anyone can use your model for prediction! Therefore, make sure not to expose any sensitive information through the functions you write, or allow any critical changes to occur on your device. If you set share=False (the default, except in colab notebooks), only a local link is created, which can be shared by  port-forwarding  with specific users. 

Share links expire after 72 hours.

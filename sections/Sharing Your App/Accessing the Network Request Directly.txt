When a user makes a prediction to your app, you may need the underlying network request, in order to get the request headers (e.g. for advanced authentication), log the client's IP address, or for other reasons. Gradio supports this in a similar manner to FastAPI: simply add a function parameter whose type hint is gr.Request and Gradio will pass in the network request as that parameter. Here is an example:
Note: if your function is called directly instead of through the UI (this happens, for 
example, when examples are cached), then request will be None. You should handle
this case explicitly to ensure that your app does not throw any errors. That is why
we have the explicit check if request.

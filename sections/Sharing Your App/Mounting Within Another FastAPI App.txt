In some cases, you might have an existing FastAPI app, and you'd like to add a path for a Gradio demo.
You can easily do this with gradio.mount_gradio_app().
Here's a complete example:
from fastapi import FastAPI
import gradio as gr

CUSTOM_PATH = "/gradio"

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_main():
    return {"message": "This is your main app"}


io = gr.Interface(lambda x: "Hello, " + x + "!", "textbox", "textbox")
app = gr.mount_gradio_app(app, io, path=CUSTOM_PATH)


# Run this from the terminal as you would normally start a FastAPI app: `uvicorn run:app`
# and navigate to http://localhost:8000/gradio in your browser.

Note that this approach also allows you run your Gradio apps on custom paths (http://localhost:8000/gradio in the example above).

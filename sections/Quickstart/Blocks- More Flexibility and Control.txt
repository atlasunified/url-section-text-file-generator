Gradio offers two classes to build apps:
1. Interface, that provides a high-level abstraction for creating demos that we've been discussing so far.
2. Blocks, a low-level API for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows. Blocks allows you to do things like feature multiple data flows and demos, control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction â still all in Python. If this customizability is what you need, try Blocks instead!

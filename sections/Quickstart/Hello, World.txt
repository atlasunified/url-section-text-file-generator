To get Gradio running with a simple "Hello, World" example, follow these three steps:
1. Install Gradio using pip:
2. Run the code below as a Python script or in a Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab):
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name + "!"

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text")

demo.launch()   
We shorten the imported name to gr for better readability of code using Gradio. This is a widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone working with your code can easily understand it.
3. The demo below will appear automatically within the Jupyter Notebook, or pop in a browser on http://localhost:7860 if running from a script:

When developing locally, if you want to run the code as a Python script, you can use the Gradio CLI to launch the application in reload mode, which will provide seamless and fast development. Learn more about reloading in the Auto-Reloading Guide.
Note: you can also do python app.py, but it won't provide the automatic reload mechanism.
